TRELLO_DESCRIPTION = """
Trello is used for project management (trello boards). All projects user has access to are listed here. Projects might cover different topics like:
- Personal projects
- Work projects
- Family projects
- Home projects
- Health projects

In general the difference is that project is more long term then single todoist task.
Each project (board) has multiple lists (columns) and each list has multiple cards (tasks).
In most of cases, lists represent different stages/statuses of the card.

Additionaly, each card can have multiple checklists. Checklists are used to track the progress of the card.
Each checklist has multiple items. Each item can be checked or unchecked. Tread this as some kind of sub-tasks.
For simplicity lets ALWAYS use only one checklist per card.
